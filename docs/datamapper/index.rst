DataMappers
===========

As the name suggests, a DataMapper will map properties on themselves to your
object. They allow you to easily write proxy objects, primarily for converting
between serialised (JSON) and live (Python) formats of your resources.

.. Warning::
    Since a DataMapper instance retain a reference to the object they are bound
    to, even when using << syntax, instances MUST NOT be shared between threads.


Field decorator: get/set
========================

DataMappers work using Python's descriptor protocol, which is most commonly
used via the `property` built-in. This gives you full control over a
DataMapper's properties. When constructing a DataMapper you can pass an
object for it to "bind" to. All field access to the DataMapper fields will
proxy to this bound object.

Here's an example to illustrate some of these concepts:

.. code-block:: python

    # An object we want to create a DataMapper for
    class Person(object):

        def __init__(self, first_name, last_name, is_alive):
            self.first_name = first_name
            self.last_name = last_name
            self.is_alive = is_alive


    from nap import datamapper

    # A DataMapper that we are creating for the Person object
    class PersonMapper(datamapper.DataMapper):
        '''
        The self argument refers to the object we bind the DataMapper to when
        we construct it. It DOES NOT refer to the instance of the PersonMapper.
        '''
        @datamapper.field
        def name(self):
            return {}.format(self.first_name, self.last_name)

        # We can use the Field class for simpler cases
        first_name = datamapper.Field('first_name')
        last_name = datamapper.Field('last_name')
        is_alive = datamapper.Field('is_alive')

    # Construct instances of the Person and a DataMapper classes
    person = Person('Jane', 'Doe', 22, True)
    mapper = DataMapper(person)

The decorator `field` works exactly like `property`, however it will operate on
the "bound" object, not the DataMapper. The Field class covers simpler cases,
as well as allowing easier control. Field's first argument is the name of the
property on the bound object it gets/sets.

Accessing extra state
---------------------

Sometimes when serialising an object, you need to provide additional state.
This can be done using a ``context_field``, which subclasses ``field`` and
additionally passes the `DataMapper` instance to the getter and setter methos.

Any extra `kwargs` passed when the `DataMapper` is instanciated are stored on
the instance in `self._context`.

DataMapper Fields
=================

DataMappers use the declarative syntax familiar from Django Models and Forms.

These are the valid supported types:

Field
-----

For simple cases where the descriptor protocol is overkill.

.. class:: Field(name, required=True, default=NOT_PROVIDED, filters=None)

   :param name: The name of the property on the bound object it gets/sets.
   :param default: The value to use if the source value is absent.
   :param filters: The filters to apply. Default: None
   :param required: Is this field required? Default: True


DigField
--------

DigFields 'dig' out the value in a similar style to the dotted lookup syntax in
Django's templates

.. class:: DigField(instance, required=True, default=NOT_PROVIDED)

    :param instance: Reference to field on another instance using dot notation
    :param default: The value to use if the source value is absent.
    :param required: Is this field required? Default: True

MapperField
-----------

Used when serialising a model that has a foreign key relation.

.. class:: MapperField(mapper, required=True, default=NOT_PROVIDED)

    :param mapper: A DataMapper that will serialise the field value.
    :param instance: Reference to a field on another instance using dot notation.
    :param default: The value to use if the source value is absent.

Filters: validation and type casting
====================================

Filters provide casting and validation functions for Fields. They form a
pipeline to help you control how your values are converted between Python and
JSON. They can be used for inbound field validation or for for outbound type
casting.

These are the built-in nap filters:

- DateFilter
- TimeFilter
- DateTimeFilter
- BooleanFilter
- IntegerFilter
- FloatFilter
- NotNullFilter

Here's a small example to show you how to use a BooleanFilter, which will
ensure the values _set_ on the is_alive property are proper Booleans. When
filters fail a ValidationError is raised.

.. code-block:: python

    from nap import datamapper


    class PersonMapper(datamapper.DataMapper):

        @datamapper.field
        def name(self):
            return "{}{}".format(self.first_name, self.last_name)

        first_name = datamapper.Field('first_name')
        last_name = datamapper.Field('last_name')
        is_alive = datamapper.Field('is_alive', filters=[BooleanFilter])


DataMapper functions
====================

A DataMapper supports several methods:

``_reduce()`` will reduce the instance to its serialisable state, returning a
dict representation of the `DataMapper`.

``_patch(data)`` will partially update (patch) a `DataMapper`'s fields with the
values you pass in the data dict. If validation fails it will raise a
`ValidationError`.

``_apply(data)`` will fully update (put) a `DataMapper`'s fields with the
values you pass in the data dict. If you don't pass a field in the data dict
it will try to set the field to the default value. If there is no default and
the field is required it will raise a `ValidationError`.

``_clean(data, full=True)`` is a hook for final pass validation. It allows you
to define your own custom cleaning code. You should update the ``self._errors``
dict. The ``full`` boolean indicates if the calling method was ``_apply``
(True) or ``_patch`` (False).

Here is some code to explain how these concepts work. We will continue to use
the Person class and PersonMapper class defined above.

Note that these methods only update the fields of the model instance. You will
need to call save() yourself to commit changes to the database.

Using _reduce:

.. code-block:: python

    p = Person('Jane', 'Doe', True)
    m = PersonMapper(p)
    reduced_p = m._reduce()
    print(reduced_p)

    # Output: {'first_name': 'Jane', 'last_name': 'Doe', 'is_alive': True}


Using _apply:

.. code-block:: python

    m = PersonMapper()
    m._apply({
        "first_name": "Jane",
        "last_name": "Doe",
        "is_alive": False
    })
    reduced = m.reduce()
    print(reduced)

    # Output: {'first_name': 'Jane', 'last_name': 'Doe', 'is_alive': False}


Using _patch:

.. code-block:: python

    p = Person('Jane', 'Doe', True)
    m = PersonMapper(p)
    m._patch({"last_name": "Notdoe"}) # This should patch last_name
    reduced = m.reduce()
    print(reduced)

    # Output: {'first_name': 'Jane', 'last_name': 'Notdoe', 'is_alive': True}

Using _clean:

.. code-block:: python

    class DeadPersonMapper(PersonMapper):
        def _clean(self):
            if self.is_alive:
                raise ValidationError("Only dead people accepted to the morgue.")

    m = DeadPersonMapper()
    m._apple({'last_name': 'Doe', 'first_name': 'John', 'is_alive': True})

    # ValidationError

Shortcuts
---------

As a convenience, DataMappers support two shorthand syntaxes:

.. code-block:: python

   >>> data = mapper << obj

This will bind the mapper to the obj, and then call ``_reduce``.

.. code-block:: python

   >>> obj = data >> mapper

This will call ``_patch`` on the mapper, passing data, and returning the
updated object.

ModelDataMappers
================

A ModelDataMapper will automatically create a DataMapper for a Django model. A
ModelDataMapper behaves very similar to a Django ModelForm, you control it by
setting some fields in an inner Meta class.

The fields that can be set are:

.. class:: ModelDataMapper

   .. attribute:: model

      Default: None
      The model this ``DataMapper`` is for

   .. attribute:: fields

      Default: []
      The list of fields to use. You can set it to '__all__' to map all fields.

   .. attribute:: exclude

      Default: []
      The list of fields to exclude from the Model

   .. attribute:: required

      Default: {}
      The list of overrides of default required values for fields inferred from
      the model.  It does not influence @field declarations.

You can rewrite the DataMapper so that it subclasses ModelDataMapper. Here's a
new Person object that subclasses Django's models.Model:

.. code-block:: python

    from django.db import models


    # An Django models.Model we want to create a DataMapper for
    class Person(models.Model):
        first_name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
        last_name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
        is_alive = models.BooleanField(default=True)

Here is the PersonMapper rewritten to use a ModelDataMapper:

.. code-block:: python

    from nap import datamapper

    # This should reference the model package where we define Person
    from . import models


    class PersonMapper(datamapper.ModelDataMapper):
        class Meta:
            model = models.Person
            fields = '__all__'

You can still use `field` to get/set properties and fields on a
ModelDataMapper. This is useful when the model contains some properties that
the ModelDataMapper cannot understand, or when you want to customise how
certain fields are represented.

To illustrate this we will add a new Django field (models.UUIDField) to our
model. UUIDField does not have a filter built in to nap, so you will need to
define your own get and set functionality using the `field` decorator.

Here is a Person model object with a UUIDField:

.. code-block:: python

    from django.db import models


    # An Django models.Model we want to create a DataMapper for
    class Person(models.Model):
        first_name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
        last_name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
        is_alive = models.BooleanField(default=True)
        uuid = models.UUIDField(default=uuid.uuid4, editable=False)

And here is a complete ModelDataMapper that will correctly handle this new type
of field:

.. code-block:: python

    from nap import datamapper

    from . import models


    class PersonMapper(datamapper.ModelDataMapper):
        class Meta:
            model = models.Person
            fields = '__all__'
            # We're defining uuid ourselves and don't want it auto-mapped.
            exclude = ['uuid']

        @datamapper.field
        def uuid(self):
            return str(self.uuid) # Remember: self refers to the bound object.

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

   datamapper
